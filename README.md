# path_tracer

##A simple yet functional cpu path tracer that can generate photo realistic image.
##This is a learning project.

Learning outcome:
  - Multithreaded : use in path tracing to reduce wait time
  - Path Tracing   : produce photo realistic image
  - This project is complete coded by me when I was learning "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". However, this is not a replica of Peter Shirley's great work. This is a non-recursive, multihreaded path tracer, compare to Shirley's recursive, single threaded path tracer.
